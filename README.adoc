=== Overview

The purpose of this template is to convert adoc-Files to html-Files
These files are divided in html-documents and html-slides. The slides are rendered using https://revealjs.com/[revealjs^].

The convertion of the adoc-files is processed in a docker-container.

=== Usage

==== Remote Rendering by github-actions

When commiting and pushing the adoc-files into github, they are automatically rendered by github-actions to html in a (new) branch `gh-pages`. All sub-folders with adoc-files are included.

==== Local Rendering

Because the rendering with gh-actions on a gh-runner takes time, it is possible to create a local dist-folder with

[source,bash]
----
./local-convert.sh
----

IMPORTANT: You need docker installed locally.

You even can publish your locally created html-slides with

[source,bash]
----
./publish.sh
----



=== Customizing

IMPORTANT: You should not change the scripts in the `asciidocs`-folder, unless you really know what to do.

* The script are available in the `asciidocs`-Folder. So you could change the options for the asciidoctor-engine or the version of revealjs.
